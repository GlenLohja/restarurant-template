                                        A very nice place to eat. We had the mussels and the arrongini for starters and then a
                                        Casio Pepe and the oxtail and they were amazing. Our waiter Angelo was very helpful
                                        and smiling and he tried to give us the best experience while we were there. I really
                                        liked that we had one waiter focused on us. Maybe our best meal while in Roma. There
                                        are seats inside or outside with both options seem good. U will have to wait a bit
                                        in the queue but it worth it.

                                        After 24,000 positive reviews, what more can I say? This place is one of the best I
                                        have eaten at…ever! It’s the food! You can’t go wrong. Do yourself, your family &
                                        friends a favor and eat here at least once! Our server Alex and the whole team made
                                        the experience that much more memorable with their excellent service! I read some of
                                        the negative reviews, and I can’t say that I agree. This is not our first time in
                                        Rome, but this is the first time we have eaten here. Again, highly recommend. Not
